<h3> Happy Valentine Micelll</h3>

       <p style="text-align:left;"> 1 planet, 7 oceans, 7 continents, 195 countries, 8 billion people, and somehow I was lucky enough to meet you…</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Hiii cell, how’s your day? Is it good?<br>
On this day, 14 February 2024, I am very glad and grateful to know you, and will always so. Thank you very much, you’ve come into my high school life and glimmered my days. I wasn’t lying about what I’ve ever said before, the first time I saw you, it felt different from the other. You have beautiful eyes, beautiful appearance, and beautiful personality. I like the way you smile, the way you talk, the way you see, the way you laugh, and many more I couldn't say here. I like everything about you.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Meeting you is one of the sweetest experiences I’ve ever had. I’ll never forget the moment when I first met you. It took me a few hours until I was finally brave enough to text you for the first time WKWKWK. After all of that, I enjoy every moment I’ve spent with you. You’ve successfully brought true happiness and joy to me. </p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Always do things that make you happy and rely on God in everything you do. May God always protect you in every journey of your life. I hope we can spend more time together. Also, I apologize if I have ever made a mistake. Lastly, my playlist name is actually referring to a girl named Michelle Valencia Valerie HHEHEHE; If I were an artist, your portraiture would be the most beautiful art I’ve made. </p>

<p style="text-align:left;">You’re out of my league. <br><br>

Sincerely, <br>
<b>Nico
